# This interview introduces fields and variables, displaying a variable in text with Mako syntax, and how a question that depends on a variable will call the question that sets that variable.
#
# Takeaways:
# - How to create a short text field, which is the default data type in Docassemble
# - Basic question punctuation/formatting
# - Variables are used to store the user's input
# - Variables are easier to use if the names make sense!
# - The LIT Lab has helpful naming conventions
# - How to use Mako syntax to insert the value of a variable into display text
# - Using a `#` at the start of a line tells Docassemble to ignore it

# Short text fields
# 1. Start by typing out the following, but with `variable1` as the variable name
# 2. Change the variable name to `full_name` because readable variable names are easier to work with! (Mention naming conventions.)
# 3. Note that clicking **Continue** results in an error, which we can fix by giving the interview an end screen.
# mandatory: True
question: What is your name?
fields:
  - Full name: full_name
---
# Displaying user input
# 1. Explain that Mako syntax is for inserting code into text
# 2. Show that we can comment out `mandatory: True` from the question above because this question depends on the answer to that one
# 3. Note the best practice that there should be only one mandatory question, and it should be at the beginning of the interview
mandatory: True
question: Hi, ${ full_name }!
