# This builds on the previous interview to demonstrate how to specify the interview order with a mandatory code block.
#
# Takeaways:
# - How to use a mandatory code block to specify the interview order
# - How to refer to a question with the `event` modifier
# - The difference between using variables in text (Mako tags required) and in a code block

# Interview order code block
# 1. Move the end-screen question block back to the end of the interview
# 2. Create this mandatory code block and add each variable from the questions below
# 3. Explain that we don't need to use Mako tags in a code block
# 4. Demonstrate that the interview order changes when the order changes in this block

# 1. Move this question block back to the end of the interview
# 2. Add the `event: show_statement` modifier, which gives us a way to add this question to the interview order code block
event: show_statement
