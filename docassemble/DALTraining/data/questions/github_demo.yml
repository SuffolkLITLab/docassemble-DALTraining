# This file is for demonstrating the GitHub workflow.
# 
# To demonstrate issues, branches, and pull requests (including a simple merge conflict), create two issues:
# 1. Ask if the user likes dogs
# 2. Ask if the user likes cats
# 
# Create two branches/pull requests, one for each issue. In each, add the relevant variable to the interview order, creating a conflict when you attempt to merge the second pull request.
