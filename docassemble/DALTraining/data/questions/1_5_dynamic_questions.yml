# 1. Sometimes you might want to ask a question differently based on the answer to another question. Use use Mako's `if`/`else`/`endif` syntax!
# 2. The `%` is a Mako tag, so you don't also need to use `${}` around variables
# 3. Saying `if eyewitness` is equivalent to `if eyewitness == True`, but sometimes it's helpful to be explicit
# 4. There is more than one way to do this, but this is probably the simplest
