# This interview demonstrates how to assemble a document using Docassemble's native document assembly features.
#
# Start by converting the "statement" interview from last session into an interview for an affidavit.
# 1. Remove `eyewitness` from the interview order and remove the question
# 2. Convert the `incident_date` question into the `signature_date` code block
# 3. Add a `signature` question
# 4. Convert the `show_statement` question block into an `assemble_affidavit` attachment block
# 5. Demonstrate that including `signature_date` in the interview order is unnecessary because it is referenced in the attachment block, but it doesn't hurt and we might want to keep it there for clarity
# 
# Takeaways:
# - How to assign a value to a variable in a code block
# - How to use the `attachment` question type to assemble a basic document
