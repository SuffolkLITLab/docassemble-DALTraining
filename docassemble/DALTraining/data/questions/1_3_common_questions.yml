# This builds on the previous interview to demonstrate some of the most common question types.
#
# When teaching this interview, build the interview slowly, adding one question at a time and updating the end screen. Try to elicit answers rather than simply giving them. Save and run the interview to show each change.
#
# Takeaways:
# - How to use the `datatype` question modifier for common question types: `yesnoradio`, `date`, `area`
# - Use plain language in questions
# - What `no label` does
# - How to use Markdown syntax to format question text

# Mandatory question/end screen
# 1. Move the end screen question to the beginning of the interview
# 2. Add the "pipe" (`|`) so we can use more than one line
# 3. Add `## ` and explain Markdown syntax
# 4. Show what happens if the indentation is missing
# 5. Add the remaining fields
# 6. Note that the interview order depends on the order of variables in this question, not the order of the question blocks
mandatory: True
question: |
  ## Statement of ${ full_name }
  
  - **Incident date:** ${ incident_date }
  - **Eyewitness:** ${ eyewitness }

  ${ incident_description }

# This question is taken from the previous interview.
question: What is your name?
fields:
  - Full name: full_name

# Yes/no questions and true/false (Boolean) variables
# 1. Start with just the question and discuss plain language. (i.e., "Were you present at the incident" v. "Did you see what happened?")
# 2. Show how to use `no label` when the question is enough
# 3. Add `datatype: yesnoradio` and explain true/false (Boolean) variables. Discuss/mention the usefulness of Boolean variables for checkboxes.
